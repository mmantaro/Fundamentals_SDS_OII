    "Prior to COVID-19, tourism was one of the most important sectors globally, accounting for 10% of global GDP and 334 million jobs (World Travel &  Tourism Council, 2021). The emergence of COVID-19 quickly threw the tourism sector into disarray, with far-reaching and extreme impacts: It put 100-120 million direct tourism jobs at stake (UNWTO, 2021a) and had a negative upstream effect into may sectors due to the lack of demand for intermediate goods and services (UNCTAD, 2021). Global tourist arrival declined by 74% year-on-year, corresponding with an estimated loss of USD 1.3 trillion in export revenues (UNWTO, 2021b).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tourism companies were impacted both by governmental restrictions—including strict border controls, restrictions on international travel, and mandatory workplace closures (Gössling et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2020; UNWTO, 2020)—as well as by increased customer anxieties (BCG, 2020; McKinsey & Company, 2020). However, tourism businesses were not static entities during this time: As COVID-19 created a new normal, the tourism sector sought at times to lessen restrictions (e.g. Aratani, 2021) and modified the way they did business, from implementing curbside pickup to limiting capacity to enable social distancing (Deloitte, 2020, p. 8-9). Much of the COVID-19-related tourism literature has focused on the implications of travel restrictions and other measures on tourism (Gössling et al., 2021). To supplement these findings, this paper explores facets of a more complex relationship between the tourism sector, consumers, and governments during COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is split into two parts. Part 1 examines whether pre-COVID international tourism revenues (as percent of GDP) impacted the speed or stringency of countries’ international travel restrictions, using data from the OxCOVID19 Database (Mahdi et al., 2021). Part 2 then explores how COVID-19 impacted Yelp reviews of tourism businesses in the United States."

    "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, politicians have largely justified travel restrictions as health interventions. However, decisions to implement travel restrictions were also influenced by non-health factors, including domestic politics, foreign policy, and/or geopolitical strategies (Seyfi et al., 2020). In order to better understand how governments attempted to balance economic well-being versus their citizens' health, RQ1 examines the relationship between the size of countries’ tourism sectors and their implementation of international travel controls: \n",

    "During the pandemic, tourism-dependent countries were hit hard by the sharp decrease in international tourism receipts (Brookings, 2021). Additionally, the travel industry actively attempted to influence government policies. For example, in April 2021, the Washington Post documented how the travel industry had lobbied the US government for months to remove international travel restrictions for visitors from the Schengen area (Aratani, 2021). Therefore, I hypothesize that:\n",

    "## Results \n",
    "\n",
    "To address RQ1, I use data from the epidemiology, government response, and World Bank tables of the OxCOVID19 Database (Mahdi et al., 2021). To provide a fair comparison of international tourism revenues by country, I load both international tourism revenues and gross domestic product (GDP) in current USD from the most recent pre-COVID year available. Note that as the OxCOVID19 Database does not include full historical data from the World Bank (2018, 2019) and this summative disallows using data from outside the OxCOVID19 Database for Part 1, I needed to normalize 2018 international tourism revenue data using 2019 GDP data. To assess the speed and stringency of travel restrictions, I import the C8 International Travel Controls indicator from the government response table, which is sourced from Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (Hale et al., 2020). This indicator provides the level of a government’s international travel restrictions in an ordinal scale: 0 for no restrictions, 1 for screening arrivals, 2 for quarantine arrivals from some or all regions, 3 for ban arrivals from some regions, and 4 for ban on all regions or total border closure. Lastly, as COVID-19 reached different countries at different times, with implications on their restriction rollout timeline (Brookings, 2020), I import cumulative daily confirmed cases by country, sourced from the Worldwide Health Organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "I merge these data tables together to get international tourism revenues (as % of GDP) and measures of the speed and stringency of international travel restrictions for each country. Countries with no travel restriction data, no confirmed case data, and/or no international tourism (% of GDP) were dropped, leaving 140 countries. Because case data went into November, but travel restrictions data ended early October, I limited the timeframe to between 1 January 2020 and 1 October 2021. A small amount (0.97%) of travel restriction data was missing for the 140 countries over this timeframe, which I interpolated by country using forward fill under the assumption that the travel restriction data is more likely to have been updated when a change in travel restrictions occurred. \n",

    "To measure speed, I calculated the time between each country’s first case and when it first implemented each of the four levels of travel restrictions. To deal with cases where a country skipped a certain level of restriction, the measure is determined from the first day at a restriction at or higher than each level. For example, if a country went straight from level 1 to level 3 travel restrictions, the country’s time to level 2 would equal the time to level 3. To measure stringency, I calculated how many days the country had any travel restrictions (level 1-4), was quarantining or banning arrivals (level 2-4 controls), had any travel bans in place (level 3-4 controls), and had a total border closure (level 4 control). You can see descriptive statistics for each of these measures in Table 1. Only two countries never implemented any travel bans, while 25 countries never had a total border closure."

The figure shows that there does not seem to be a pattern in the speed of timeline restrictions when normalized against day of first case: The rollout of restrictions hovers around the day of the first confirmed case (Day 0) regardless of tourism level."

The top four scatterplots correspond to the speed measures, while the bottom four scatterplots correspond to the stringency measures. A few influential, extreme outliers were present in the speed measures, possibly due to anomalies in how quickly the first case appeared. To keep these from unduly suggesting a significant relationship, I trimmed any speed outliers with a z-score of over 3. None of the scatterplots had a significant p-value for the correlation between the measure international tourism (% of GDP): P-values for speed measures ranged from 0.12 to 0.5 and p-values for stringency measures ranged from 0.13 to 0.61. Similarly, the 95% confidence interval for the linear regression lines clearly straddle a slope of 0 for every measure except 'Days with controls', meaning we cannot be confident of either a positive or negative relationship between tourism as percent of GDP and our speed or stringency measures. We therefore cannot reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists between pre-COVID international tourism levels and the implementation speed or stringency of travel restrictions. This is perhaps because governments largely prioritized public safety over more economic considerations, although further research would be needed to confirm this."

    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "As cases rose and restrictions went into place, many US tourism businesses were forced to close or modify their businesses (OECD, 2020). Even after restrictions lessened, tourism businesses had to contend with increased customer anxieties. BCG’s COVID-19 Consumer Sentiment Survey from May 22-25, 2020 (N = 3,238) found that “worry” was a major constraint preventing respondents from doing tourism-related activities: More than 40% of respondents cited worry as the top reason for avoiding leisure travel, out-of-home entertainment, and eating at restaurants (BCG, 2020). To reduce anxiety, businesses began taking a number of measures, including increased sanitization, limited occupancy to maintain physical distancing, and requiring employees to wear personal protective equipment (McKinsey & Company, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have found noticeable increases in negative emotions reflected in online discourse during the pandemic. For example, one study found that posts in Reddit's largest hospitality-employee subreddit increased in anxiety, negative emotions, and anger during the pandemic (Park et al., 2020). Multiple other studies have found that restaurant reviews were also impacted by COVID-19. Cao et al. analyzed 3.1 million Yelp reviews using several machine learning techniques and found that more than 10% of reviews contained COVID-related keywords and that the prevalence of these keywords increased over the course of the pandemic (2021). Other studies have found that the lack of a COVID-safe dining environment has caused negative emotions towards restaurants and is associated with lower ratings (e.g. Kostromitina et al., 2021; Foroudi et al., 2021; Luo and Xu, 2021). Reviews are important to tourism businesses: They affect potential customers’ perceptions of businesses (Browning et al., 2013), customer demand (Phillips et al., 2017), and likelihood to book (Zhao et al., 2015), with implications on the popularity and success of restaurants (Anderson and Magruder, 2012). However, studies have largely focused on reviews within the dining industry rather than examining reviews within the broader tourism industry. This paper thus examines US Yelp reviews of tourism businesses according to RQ2:\n",

    "> $RQ_2$: How did COVID-19 impact Yelp reviews in the tourism sector? "

    "## Results \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on reviews of US tourism businesses, I combine case data from the OxCOVID19 Database (Mahdi et al., 2021) with business and review data from Yelp, an online directory which enables users to find local businesses and publishes crowd-sourced reviews about these businesses. Yelp freely provides a selection of its data for research purposes (Yelp, n.d.-a). It does not allow researchers to access data via an API, but rather requires any potential users to fill out a form with their name and email that confirms consent with their terms of use. I therefore use the Mechanize library to fill out the form and download a zip file with the JSON data before reading the JSON files into DataFrames. Although the Yelp Open Dataset only provides a small fraction of the total data on the platform (see the section ‘Limitations and Conclusions’ below for a deeper discussion), using this dataset does have one benefit over the methods utilized by some other papers: It includes more historical data than web scraping methods that are only able to access the first page of reviews and therefore miss reviews from pre-pandemic and/or earlier in the pandemic (Kostromitina et al., 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "I use the JSON files with review and business data, selecting data starting from January 1, 2020 to provide insights into review characteristics before COVID-19 disrupted the tourism industry. From the reviews table, I capture the stars (how highly a reviewer has rated the business, on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5), the business ID (used to connect the business data to the review), and the reviews themselves. From the business table, I capture location data and the business category. The category column provides a list of any number of categories that apply to a business; in total, 88,115 unique categories are captured within this field. I therefore use text filtering to assess whether each business belongs to one or more of the following tourism categories: hotel, transport, dining, and activity. I create separate Boolean categories for each rather than just one new column with category because businesses can fall under more than one category (e.g., a hotel with a restaurant would be tagged as both hotel and dining). Then I limit the business DataFrame to just tourism industries (going from 160,585 businesses to 77,985 businesses) before merging with the reviews data using inner join to drop any non-tourism reviews. Because countries differed in terms of restrictions and cases (Brookings, 2020), I only keep reviews from the US. In total, I end up with 450,547 reviews of US tourism businesses between 1 January 2020 and 28 January 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze how reviews that mention COVID-related words differed from other reviews, I identify key terms to check for. Given the complexity of language, no single list of will be exhaustive. However, to make sure I don’t miss any key COVID-related words, I run a Naïve Bayes model on a random sample of 50,000 reviews to identify the words that most predict whether a review was from before or after COVID. While the model is not very useful as a predictor (it performs slightly worse than just assuming all of the reviews are post-COVID), it does provide a useful list of the words that are most likely to show up in a post-COVID review, which I use as a guide when building out my own lists of COVID-related words to check for. Ultimately, I decide on 20 COVID-related words across four distinct categories: \n",
    "* words relating to the COVID crisis itself (COVID, coronavirus, pandemic, corona, virus)\n",
    "* words relating to measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID (mask, distance, sanitize, gloves, sanitizer, quarantine, enforce, measure) \n",
    "* words relating to cancellations (refund, cancel, cancellation)\n",
    "* words related to services that became much more common during the pandemic (curbside, deliver, contactless, delivery)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then create columns with the number of words relating to each of the four COVID-19 word categories as well as the total number of COVID-19-related words in each review, and a Boolean column that indicates whether each review includes any COVID-19-related words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 plots review count and average review rating over time against daily US case counts. Total reviews dropped sharply in March, reflecting rising cases and new restrictions, including the required closure of certain sectors and businesses on March 16, 2020. Reviews increased somewhat between April and September as the US relaxed restrictions, before slightly dropping again as the third and largest peak in COVID cases hit the US in the fall and winter. Even as total reviews dropped, however, reviews that mentioned COVID-related terms increased. These reviews were more negative than reviews that didn’t include COVID-related terms, bringing down the average rating—albeit only slightly. This matches findings from other studies around reviews during COVID-19 (e.g. Kostromitina et al., 2021; Foroudi et al., 2021; Luo and Xu, 2021). Overall, however, average ratings did not vary much over time."

    "Figure 5 plots the share of reviews that mention different types of COVID-related words and the average rating of these reviews over time. Among the four categories of COVID-related words, words mentioning the crisis itself were the most common. All four categories increased in prevalence (measured as percent of total reviews) in March before decreasing at the tail end of the first peak in cases. Reviews that mentioned the COVID crisis itself or COVID-related measures increased again with the second peak in cases. Mentions of service changes and cancellations did not show a similar rise in mentions with the second or third peak, but did remain at an elevated level compared to the pre-COVID period. Average rating levels remained constant throughout the pandemic (with greater pre-pandemic variance likely due to the small number of reviews that mentioned these words). Reviews around cancellations had a significantly lower rating on average than reviews that included any of the other three categories of COVID-related words."

    "The rating drop when COVID-related words are mentioned becomes even more pronounced the more times a review mentions these words. Figure 6 shows the impact of COVID anxieties on people's perceptions of tourism-related businesses. Not only is the average rating of reviews that mentioned COVID-related words lower, but the average rating of reviews decreases the more times they are mentioned. As found earlier, the average ratings do not seem to vary significantly over time, however. As Figure 7 shows, this trend holds true across the four different categories of COVID-related words, although the effect for crisis, measures, and service words are less extreme than words around cancellation: On average, even a single mention of ‘cancel,’ ‘cancellation,’ or ‘refund’ in a review is associated a negative star rating."

    "To see whether the effect holds true across different types of tourism businesses, Figure 8 plots review counts and ratings by tourism business type. Although the different tourism businesses did differ in terms of the number of weekly reviews (the dining category has much more reviews on a weekly basis) and the average rating (the hotel category has notably lower average ratings), the COVID-19-related trends are consistent between categories. Each category saw reviews drop sharply in March and slowly increase in the summer before decreasing again in the winter, and reviews that mentioned COVID-19-related terms did drag down the average review rating for all four types of tourism businesses. Moreover, Figure 9 shows that the number of times a COVID-19-related word was used did have a negative impact on the rating for each type of tourism business on average, although the negative impact to hotel and activity reviews seems to be concentrated at the beginning of the pandemic."

    "This analysis of US tourism reviews on Yelp shows that COVID-19 did have an impact on consumer perceptions of these businesses, with negative sentiment towards COVID-19-related topics spilling over into the text and star ratings of reviews. Overall, this analysis adds credence to findings from past studies around negative sentiments in reviews when COVID-19 safety measures aren’t followed (e.g. Kostromitina et al., 2021; Foroudi et al., 2021; Luo and Xu, 2021) and underlines the need for businesses to implement pandemic modifications for their customers."

    "# Limitations and conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key limitations constrain the conclusions from Part 1. Firstly, the World Bank table in the OxCOVID19 Database doesn’t include full time-series data, which meant that 2018 tourism revenues had to be compared with 2019 GDP. While this still enabled a consistent method of comparing revenues, it could introduce some inaccuracies if, for example, a country’s currency changed drastically between 2018 or 2019. Although outside the bounds of this summative, this could be easily resolved in future research by using timewise-consistent data directly from the World Bank. Secondly, the Government Measures table did not include data on a few island countries with high levels of tourism (including Antigua and Barbuda, the Maldives, Saint Lucia, and others). Even for the countries that did have data within the Government Measures table, the manual methods used to create the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker introduce the possibility of entry errors or language misunderstandings, although the researchers actively sought to minimize these errors and ensure coding consistency through trainings and meetings as well as the use of a second coder to review every data point (Hale et al., 2021). Additionally, Part 1's analysis relies on the day of a country's first case to normalize speed. However, this could be impacted by confounding factors—e.g. how connected a country is to the rest of the world—that are not considered. Lastly, other factors might moderate the relationship between the size of the tourism industry and travel controls. To further explore the relationship, future research could account for lobbying power and/or the size of the largest travel players in each country, as this could impact how much the government would be willing to listen to the tourism sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of Part 2 are also significantly caveated by limitations with the data and analysis. Firstly, the analysis is limited to the US, and the Yelp Open Dataset is limited to a small set of metropolitan areas (Yelp, n.d.-b). As different US states varied with respect to acceptance of COVID-19 safety measures (Fischer et al., 2021), future research could delve more deeply into whether these regional differences appeared in reviews. Secondly, the Yelp Open Dataset only includes reviews that Yelp recommended at the time of data collection (Yelp, n.d.-b). Thirdly,  Yelp’s user base skews younger, more affluent, and more highly educated than the general population (Bliss, 2021). Further research should examine whether the findings from this analysis hold for other regions and/or on alternative review sites. Lastly, the analysis relies on counts of specific COVID-19-related words rather than a more sophisticated language analysis."
